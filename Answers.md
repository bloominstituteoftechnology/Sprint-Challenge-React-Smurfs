1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Client-side routing loads all necessary resources for a website on initial load, and then routes the user based on resources that have already been retrieved.  This means we don't need to wait for a response from a server or a refresh on each page change.  Server-side routing sends requests to a server for each individual page, and therefore loads quicker initially, but is slower when being routed between pages.
