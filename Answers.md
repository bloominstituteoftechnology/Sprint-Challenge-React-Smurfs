1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server-side routing uses get requests from the server when a link is clicked and causes a whole page reload.

Client-side rounting is when routes are handled locally by the javascript loaded on the page.  This allows for quick loads between the pages as there is no need for new get requests from the server most of the time.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?

HyperText Transfer Protocol.

3.  What does CRUD stand for?

Create, Read, Update and Delete.

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

Post, Get, Put, Delete. 

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

FETCH, AXIOS, jQUERY
