1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Client side routing is the origional method for routing. When we enter the website, the server will send us the HTML, JS and render it on the page. Then whenever we make a change like, hit a button,  or fill out a form, a new request is made sending us new data which has to be loaded and rendered.
Server side routing sends us all the data for the website all at once, which causes longer initial load times, but makes any future UI change instant, giving us a faster over all experience.
