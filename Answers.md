## Question1

Routing, in general, describes the movement between different types of major interfaces.  Traditionally, in Web 1.0 and even today, this could me routing between different "pages" of a domain or beyond; however, in today's compartmentalized UI structures this essentially could represent the process of routing between different rendered states.  Currently, there are two major approaches for routing depending on which end is handling it.  Client-side routing refers to routing being handled more so by the front-end and not the back-end, otherwise known as the client-side vs. the server-side.   Client-side routing, therefore, does not rely on achieving routing by sending inforamation to the server and waiting for a response back from the server.  Instead, the client-side handles the routing and this does lead to some pros.  It also has some cons.  Some pros include portion re-rendering, less wait time after the initial page load for rendering, and more fluid and seamless transitions between rendering different UIs. The cons include tasks that may disalign with this type of behavior and not be applicable to all routing situations.  Server-side routing also has its pros and conn as well.  Being a well established method for routing for years of the web, many browsers can handle it and deal with it seamlessly.  It also invovles requesting only needed information, nothing more or less, and due to its established traditions on the web, ties in with efficient SEO and browser meta processes. 

## Question2

HTTP === 'Hyper Text Transfer Protocol" and it outlines how information is encoded and structured on the web and the actions that servers and browsers take in response to the receiving of that information.

## Question3

CRUD stands for CREATE/READ/UPDATE/DELETE and describes the four necessary functions of a sustained database, API, or informational-based collection that interacts with elements that access data from it.  Essentially and literally, one should be able to CREATE new data and add it to the database, access any data in the database at any point of time or READ the data, change existing data or UPDATE it at any point in time, and finally remove or DELETE data from the database, if desired.
