1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Routing is how a website is navigated. When the user clicks on a link, this changes the URL and the user needs to be provided with new data or a new page. If the request causes the whole page to refresh,this is done with server-side routing. A new 'GET' request is sent to the server and a new page is created, and the old one is thrown away. Client-sde routing means that the request is handled by the Javascript on the page. The adjustment results in a changed state of the application. The webpage looks different, but the whole page will not refresh.
