1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
server side route occurs when user clicks on a link and in turn a request is made for a new page from the "server".  It causes the whole page to refresh (disregarding the old page the user was previously on).  In client side routing the route is handled internally by the JS that is loading on the page(URL changes but request to server is prevented) yet not the whole page refreshes (only a few elements inside the application do).
