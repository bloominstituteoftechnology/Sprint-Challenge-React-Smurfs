# Assessing your Redux/Axios Foo
* The purpose of this exercise is to get you used to being quizzed on _Interview Questions_ commonly asked about Redux.
* Answers to your written questions will be recorded in *Answers.md* 
* This is to be worked on alone but you can use outside resources. You can *reference* any old code you may have, and the React Documentation, however, please refrain from copying and pasting any of your answers. Try and understand the question and put your responses in your own words. Be as thorough as possible when explaining something. 
* **Just a friendly Reminder** Don't fret or get anxious about this, this is a no-pressure assessment that is only going to help guide you here in the near future. This is NOT a pass/fail situation. 
## Start by forking and cloning this repository.
